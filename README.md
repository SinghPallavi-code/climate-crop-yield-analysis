# Climate–Crop-Yield Analysis (Work in Progress)

Predicting crop yield using climate and environmental variables using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

## Objectives
- Clean and merge multi-source climate and crop yield data
- Perform EDA and visualize climate → yield relationships
- Build baseline regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Deliver actionable insights and a short report for stakeholders

## Repo structure
- /notebooks  — Jupyter notebooks (EDA, modeling)
- /data       — raw and processed datasets (placeholders)
- /reports    — one-page summary and visuals
- README.md

Work in progress — updates coming soon.
